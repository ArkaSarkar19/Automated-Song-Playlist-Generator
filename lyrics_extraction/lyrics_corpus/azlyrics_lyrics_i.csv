"immortal technique","https://www.azlyrics.com/i/immortaltechnique.html","dance with the devil","https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/immortaltechnique/dancewiththedevil.html",", i once knew a nigga whose real name was william, his primary concern, was making a million, being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen, he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams, a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen, nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend, she put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober, her son's heart simultaneously grew colder, he started hanging out, selling bags in the projects, checking the young chicks, looking for hit-and-run prospects, he was fascinated by material objects, but he understood money never bought respect, he built a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal, but got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal, so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real, you see, me and niggas like this have never been equal, i don't project my insecurities on other people, he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles, so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil, a feeble-minded young man with infinite potential, the product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental, coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed, dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed, but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed, everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences, you probably only did a month for minor offences, ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance, but then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance, dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block, but that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock, devils used to be gods angels that fell from the top, there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot, so billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do, to get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew, starting fights over little shit, up on the block, stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock, working overtime for making money for the crack spot, hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine, fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain, tired of the block niggas treating him the same, he wanted to be major like the cut-throats and the thugs, but when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love, they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs, any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs, any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood, even puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club, but only a real thug can stab someone till they die, standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes, billy realized that these men were well-guarded, and they wanted to test him before business started, suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted, so now he had a choice between going back to his life, or making money with made men, up in the cife, his dreams about cars and ice made him agree, a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be, and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three, they drove around the projects slow while it was raining, smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment, until they saw a woman on the street walking alone, three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home, and so they quietly got out the car and followed her, walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her, they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor, "this is it kid, now you got your chance to be raw.", so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair, and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there, she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs, they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground, screaming, "shut the fuck up and stop moving around!", the shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed, so billy stomped on the bitch, 'til he broken her jaw, them dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing, they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving, blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently, and then they all proceeded to rape her violently, billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn, ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned, her broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned, when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised, one of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two, they told him that she was a witness for what she'd gone through, and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew, he thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead, and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head, i'm falling and i can't turn back, i'm falling and i can't turn back, right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life, he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice, and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers, cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover, but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter, 'cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother, she looked back at him and cried, 'cause he had forsaken her, she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her, his whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate, his corruption had successfully changed his fate, and he remembered how his mom used to come home late, working hard for nothing, 'cause now what was he worth, he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth, and crying out to the sky 'cause he was lonely and scared, but only the devil responded, 'cause god wasn't there, and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold, and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul, they say death takes you to a better place but i doubt it, after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it, and listen 'cause the story that i'm telling is true, 'cause i was there with billy jacobs and i raped his mom too, and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go, in fact, i'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows, and every street cypher listening to little thugs flow, he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know, the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked, white, brown, yellow and black color is not restricted, you have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted, and you'll be one of god's children that fell from the top, there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot, so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never, because a dance with the devil might last you forever, oh y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? well it's not. you didn't count on a fallen angel getting back into the grace of god and coming after you. ya'll niggas ain't shit, your producers ain't shit. your fuckin' a & r ain't shit. i'll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal. yo, diabolic, take this motherfucker's head off!, go 'head and grip glocks, i'll snap your trigger finger in six spots, you'll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots, i'll watch you topple flat, put away your rings and holla back, can't freestyle, you're screwed off the top like bottle caps, beneath the surface, i'm overheatin' your receiving circuits by unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches, what you preach is worthless, your worship defeat the purpose, like president bush takin' bullets for the secret service, beyond what y'all fathom, i shit on cats and jaw tap 'em, show no compassion like havin' a straight-faced orgasm, tour jack 'em, have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friend's dick, in the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist, diabolic, a one-man brigade spreading cancer plague, this fuckin' a pussy's face, holdin' a hand grenade, so if i catch you bluffin', faggot, you're less than nothin', i just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction, you motherfuckers are nothing, you cannot harm me, i'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army, storm the planet huntin' you down, 'cause i'm on a mission, to split your body into a billion one-celled organisms, immortal technique'll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch, you're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix, i'm 'bout to blow up like nasa challenger computer chips, arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily, i'm like time itself, i'm gonna kill you inevitably, chemically bomb you, fuck usin' a chrome piece, i'm illmatic, you won't make it home like jerome's niece, i'll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me, and then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy, this puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology, so you're nothing, like diversity without equality, and your crew is full of more faggots than greek mythology, usin' numerology to count the people i sent to heaven, produces more digits than 22 divided by 7, you're like kevin spacey, your style is usually suspect, you never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet, your mind is empty and spacious, like the part of the

niggas always talking about how they smoke kids, but the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play, "i'm not even interested" is what her body language would say, everyone around the way gave up trying to get in it, it didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it, on the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it, talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it, 'cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it, and no one ever gave them shit except mcdonald's and did-dick, smoking weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it, she spoke intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy, but when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy, she had a style, all her own, respectful and pure, i was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure, don't

glad, that i wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it, so every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute, i didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours, on her birthday i gave her a poem with flowers, then i took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower, we talked about power to the people and such, we spent more time together, but it was never enough, i never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel, i was too interested in keeping it real, perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me "carino" and never technique, bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks, forever changing the expression of my thoughts when i speak, it was because of her i even deaded all of my freaks, she convinced me to stop hanging out on the streets, to stop robbin' and stealing from people like you, instead i took her out to the apollo and the bronx zoo, museo del barrio, and the metropolitan too, got to the point when i was either with her or my crew, so i decided one day to tell her my feelings was true, i couldn't live without her, so i told her, facing my fears, but honey's only response was a face full of tears, she could only sob hysterically, holding me tight, i tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until i left sight, i felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light, except i didn't burn, i turned cold after that night, don't you know that time waits for no man?, my fate, it's all planned, i'm blessed just to know you, i've loved and i've lost just to hold you all night, can't find a reason why, god came between you and i, if i had the chance again, i'd never let you go, hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know, i went on with my life, college and my career, ended up locked up like an animal for a year, where the c.o.'s talk to you like they were the overseer, then i got sent to the hole when my exit was near, at night in my cell, i'd close my eyes and i'd see her, hold her close in my dreams, but when i woke she disappeared, just an empty cell until the state gave me parole, in the summer, came back, intact and on track, but the fact of the matter is i still felt cold, even after my mother hugged me, crying at home, my real niggas would catch me thinking, outta my zone, fucking lots of different women, but i still felt alone, relatively well-known around the new york underground, but i kept thinking of her and how we used to be down, the sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair, though gone physically, somehow it was still there, i had to do something because the shit was too much to bear, so i went and visited the building where she used to live, the world looks a lot different after you do a bid, the way your life done changed, while primitive minds are still stuck in the same game, like her cousin who was on the corner, slanging cocaine, stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name, her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta, but her facial expression changed, when i asked about her daughter, don't you know that time waits for no man?, my fate, it's all planned, i'm blessed just to know you, i've loved and i've lost just to hold you all night, can't find a reason why, god came between you and i, if i had the chance again, i'd never let you go, hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know, she told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind, and she had left it there waiting for such a long time, i was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first, i saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed, she told me where the letter was, and i started thinking the worst, reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door, and sure enough there was an envelope, with my name on the floor: "nobody loves you more than me, carino," is what the letter said, "by the time you get to read this, i'll probably be dead, but when you left in '97, a part of me went to heaven, i thank god at least i got to know what love really was, but it hurt me to see what true love really does, 'cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was, it was because i loved you so much that i had to make you leave, you made me doubt the way i thought, you made me want to believe, and then i slipped up, and i let you get close to me, it was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me, this was not the way i thought my life was supposed to be, baby, don't you see?, i had a blood transfusion that left me with hiv, hope didn't exist for me since late in 1993, i died a virgin, i wish i could've given myself to you, i cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you, promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably, no matter what, i'll keep your love forever with me", what happened for the rest of the day is still a blur, but i remember wishing that i was dead, instead of her, she was buried on august 3rd, the story ends without a sequel; and now

doit s'accomplir dans tout l'univers, a la vitesse de la lumiere, l'influx cerebral evolue, aboutit a un esprit complexe comme on ne l'a jamais vu, double sa puissance a chaque nouvelle connaissance, en presence de mes sens je ne retiens que la quintessence de la science, meme en transe je garde la reminiscence, que le pays ou je vis a ete envahi par la danse, et les corps glissent dans ce flow hypnotique, un soupcon de musique orientale afro-asiatique, en deux meme termes, la prophetie renait, 3275 ans apres, la spiritualite l'emporte sur les forces materielles, la puissance divine en extension descend du ciel, prends garde, prends garde, humain, car le reflet de ta vanite, va sortir du miroir et t'etrangler, vos ancetres le savaient, pour cela ils ont ecrit, aujourd'hui, a quoi cela a servi?, le temps tue le physique, mais l'esprit demeure, rien ne parvient a le briser, pharaon reviens, l'humanite entiere, sous le joug de quelques matieres, de metaux et de pierres, comment demeurer sincere?, c'est ce qui jadis perdit l'etre de chaire dans un realisme, d'anthropomorphisme, au depend du monotheisme solaire, mystique pere de l'islam, sheitan, mon ame t'envoie dans les flammes, car mon coeur est pierre noire, mon souffle est oriental, mon oeil droit est un croissant, mon oeil gauche une etoile, la poussiere leche les contours blancs des mosquees, et la voix de bilal s'echappe du haut des minarets, je sens des frissons dans mon dos resonnant comme un appel, du cote des contrees ou le soleil s'eleve dans le ciel, des plats ciseles de cuivre jaune, une odeur de the, la chaleur m'assomme, des milliers d'unites, un centre immuable, d'un motif qui revient et revient, invariable, les legions de la force du 7 aux quatre coins de l'horizon, assurent la securite sempiternelle, re-hor-akhti, superbe et supreme, dans la voute celeste, inonde le double-pays de kempt, je cree une fresque et le texte est une arabesque, focalise ma pensee a l'orient vers la mecque, comme les bacteries, les plantes et les betes, je vis et etudie les paroles de 144 000 prophetes, et dans ma bibliotheque, plonge dans l'anthropologie, ou l'analyse du spectre lumineux, voue au succes de mes essais, pour etendre le champ de vision de l'infrarouge a l'ultraviolet, mes etudes ne se font pas dans des tubes, elles sont le produit de 1700 cm3, defiant toutes les lois physiques observees, pour une fois la lumiere jaillit de l'obscurite, des couleurs vives animent ces rimes, comme l'a fait michel-ange sur le plafond de la chapelle sixtine, a la seule difference ou je pratique, un art mosaique de l'unique a l'interieur du multiple, tel khalife al mahmoun qui prit byzance naguere, je ne reclame que des livres anciens pour butin de guerre, car mon dogme est le savoir de ce que l'homme a laisse choir, avant la destruction de la partie orientale de notre histoire, le tiers-monde et sa misere materielle, l'occident et sa misere spirituelle, la connaissance mutuelle, pour qu'il existe un lendemain, pharaon reviens, je reve d'avoir ce livre ouvert sous mes yeux, en trois langues differentes: latin, arabe et hebreux, il contient le savoir ultime et la sagesse infime, des inities egyptiens, libanais disciples du calife al hakim, amenophis iv en est le pere et le fils, illustre ancetre de la secte des batenis, mon dieu n'a pas de statue, c'est un fond pas une forme, il serait pretentieux de lui donner celle d'un homme, dans nos genes sont inscrites les essences de la creation, initiatique, divine est la raison, puis vint la contraire, puis vint l'esprit puis la base, puis vint le verbe, puis le precedent, enfin le suivant, tel est le cierge du monotheisme incite, 2 essences pour le mal, 5 en toute limite, a ne pas franchir, ou le demon te ligote, car quiconque depasse les frontieres de dieu est un despote, paix a ceux qui obeissent au sadr el islam, et gardent des principes purs de tout exegese erronee, honte a ceux qui disent qu'un homme ecrivit le coran, denommant les musulmans mahometans, maintenant pour les ignares obscurs moyenageux, chevaliers croises, croyant toujours aussi fort sans s'informer, que les musulmans ont un dieu different, les chretiens arabes l'appellent aussi allah precise le vatican, ces gens sourient avec une suffisance, qui n'a d'egal que l'insuffisance de leurs connaissances, "oui, mais voyez comme ces gens sont stricts", "pas de contraintes dans la religion": sourate 2 verset 256, le coran respecte ainsi les croyants d'autres confessions, citant les juifs et chretiens comme etant dignes d'admiration, oppose au developpement des sciences l'occident, pendant de nombreux siecles appris beaucoup de l'orient, et il est temps de le dire, car notre arbre est le prisonnier d'une formidable spire, l'histoire, du cote de l'aube debuta, et vers les terres du crepuscule chemina, sais-tu ce qu'il y aura si le ciel reste sanguin?, la nuit. pharaon reviens, le cote obscur vous a presente

se faner, caner, tel un tox, flaner, planer, se faire oublier, pret a enterrer, le monde se divise en deux parties, le bien et le mal, y'a pas cinquante chemins cousin, tu comprends, mes rimes s'etalent, rale, je represente les chacals, pale a cause des sticks qu'on extermine, comme un tueur a gage nique ces balles, combien de mes potes partent sans me dire au revoir, combien fonctionnent avec des doses en gramme qui parcourent le sang, comme le mal a parcouru le temps, de temps en temps la foi apparait, on fait du bien apres ca disparait, la realite de nos jours est dure a accepter, bon pate ou bien se faire chier, il faut choisir, du matin au soir, apres l'action comme un pouilleux cherchant des francs, pour assouvir mes desirs de clando, hjo, facile a planter dans le dos, sous l'effet des tah kes gnah cours les kah sah c'est pas facile, jouer le mauvais garcon style le devil, mais le soir dans le quartier c'est pas pareil, les peres dorment, les fils se reveillent, les anges dorment, les bliss se reveillent, le soir dans le quartier j'entend les demons ricaner, contempler l'enfer defonce c'est pas cense, depenser sans compter sur la sense, aussi coince, marie-janne

esperant que ca va changer, mais dresse tes barricades et tu les verras tous hesiter, garni d'incomprehension et de steles geantes, le globe reve de compassion et de bourgeons renaissants sur ses branches, les memes qu'on laissera crever un soir de decembre, dans le silence, juste un bout de carton pour s'etendre, "tout le monde a ses chances", de quelle planete vient celui qu'a dit ca?, un homme politique, je crois en live de bora bora, pendant que les foyers subissent, facon tora tora, mais bon c'est bien trop bas, alors forcement il ne nous voit pas, parole et paroles et paroles, ils ont promis monts et merveilles, mais les merveilles se sont envolees, il reste que des monts, mais c'est raide a grimper, et au sommet, y a que des demons en costumes cendres, et en bas, c'est les jeux du cirque "cesar ave", parce qu'on va se faire bouffer par des fauves qu'ils ont dresses, on note une severe chute de sang sur la map, une montee d'or noir, un jour on payera cher pour une bouffee d'air pur, ici c'est chacun sa culture, chacun son racisme, seulement sur fond blanc, c'est le noir qui reste la meilleure cible, les temps changent c'est sur, mais y a toujours des irascibles, ils ont le bonjour d'henry, d'arron, mormeck et zinedine, a l'heure ou les gens dinent, y en a encore trop qui cherchent, pour eux pas de 8 pieces: ils crechent au parking, tout le monde s'en indigne, ca devalue le quartier, ca effraye meme, et on sait bien ce que meme va voter, du haut de leurs tours de biz', droites comme la tour de pise, jumelles sur le pif, ils fractionnent, divisent a leur guise, on s'etonne ensuite que ca finisse en fratricide, car tout ce qui compte c'est de gonfler les commandes de missiles, vive la democratie, celle qui brandit la matraque, face a des pacifistes: t'es pas d'accord, on te frappe, multirecidivistes: c'est jamais ceux-la qu'on traque, ils vivent en haut des listes et mettent leurs tronches sur les tracts, ce monde agonise, vu ce qu'on y fait, c'etait previsible, comme la goutte sur le front, des que la merde se profile, mais la peur atrophie les coeurs, peur de tout ce qu'on connait pas, alors on se barde de prejuges debiles, de partout les extremes dominent, en prime time, a chaque fois qu'ils deciment une famille, et bien avant ces regions ou sevit la famine, image trop crue pour un beauf devant sa viande trop cuite, lui qui croyait que l'euro ferait beaucoup d'heureux, pour les vacances faudra attendre un peu ou gagner aux jeux, mais la c'est pas trop l'heure, demain tres tot y a le taff, comprend ce monde va trop vite, aucune chance qu'on le rattrape, sur la route des principes, ils ont mis des pieges a loups, des gilets dynamites, et des skeuds y en a un peu partout, faudra faire gaffe aux mines, aux puits d'ou la mort s'ecoule, il a beau etre vif, mais a la longue il evitera pas tout, et un de ces quatre il finira par tomber, j'espere qu'il y a aura quelqu'un pour aider le prochain a se relever, j'espere qu'il sera pas comme le notre, aigri et creve, et j'espere surtout que celui-la essayera pas de se faire sauter, tu sais, on vit dans la tele, le globe s'est fele, ils servent de l'emballe mais en vrai c'est la mele, on s'prend a esperer des choses simples, mais leur fabrique a peur s'est mise en branle, tout ca pour les deregler, cris sans cicatrices, terreur dans la matrice, ils disent qu'une vie vaut plus a new york paris londres ou madrid, alors c'est comme ca une echelle dans la peine, on aime ces catastrophes quand des gens manquent a l'appel, surtout s'ils nous ressemblent, on les filme a la morgue, et nous dans les sofas content d'echapper a la mort, il reste dans les coeurs anomalie appelee peur, et grace a ca de toutes parts ils ont recours a la force, c'est une revolution, cette fois elle est de droite, voila pourquoi le chantage a l'emploi dans plein de boites, voila pourquoi ils veulent a tout prix implanter la croix, et face a la tele souvent on les croit dans leur droit, ils disent c'est humanitaire, mais ils niquent les mers et la terre pour chaque ecart c'est la guerre, si le quotidien est precaire, c'est qu'ils nous dressent a etre deleteres et se contenter de joies ephemeres, si l'afrique est en colere, c'est parce que les trusts la pillent, seuls les generaux corrompus cooperent, et jouent des vies au poker, est-ce que la rancoeur et le desir d'revanche est tout ce qu'on leur a offert?, on parle du droit des femmes quand leur mari les frappent, avec des cliches religieux sortis tout droit des fables, comme ci ici elles etaient bien depuis le moyen-age, mais c'est en 46 que c'est ouverte une nouvelle page, maintenant elles nous valent, on dit dans les ouvrages, pourquoi elles touchent moins de pognon a competences egales?, pourquoi elles seraient moins faites pour etre responsables?, alors qu'elles nous ont tous torche le cul nu dans le sable, on force sur la boisson, parie sur les canassons, mais la realite, c'est qu'ils nous font bouffer du poison, et dans l'hotel du bonheur beaucoup font la valise, l'espoir tue par des fanatiques liberalistes, pas de bombes sales, ni de grosses salves, la strategie est simple ils exploitent et ils affament, quand on les voit a la tele ces cons ont l'air affables, mais le monde est a genoux quand ces bandits sont dix a table, des comptes sous faux noms, ils pretendent agir au nom de la liberte, mais c'est la monarchie du pognon, la france et les states par factions interposees, se livrent une guerre en afrique, et tu veux rester pose?, freedom par-ci democratie par-la, mais j'ai mate sous la table et j'ai vu que c'etait que des palabres, la vraie mafia on la cherche pas en calabre ni dans ce bled, ou dans les quartiers pauvres a quarante ans on tombe malade, a fumer du mauvais tabac et manger de la merde, ou le xanax fait un tabac avec l'alcool fort, les rues deviennent des grosses forges, et le metal y est commun monte sur grosses crosses, la violence au quotidien de tant de gosses pauvres, et moi j'attends l'apocalypse apres cette apostrophe, j'en ai marre de tous ces mensonges qu'ils colportent, pour les servir, dans de nombreux cas il y a mort d'hommes, tous terroristes j'entends leurs theories, vanter le sacrifice pour des principes c'est horrible, les momes survivent nourris a l'eau et au riz, pendant que leur pouf se baladent a aspen ou st-moritz, la flore crame, la faune canne, dit: c'etait des barbus qui lachaient l'agent orange, sur le nord viet nam? nah, c'etait les boys, mais qui peut m'indiquer la justesse d'une cause, en partant de la, chacun ecrit ses droits, desole je trouve aucune excuse a hiroshima, on peint l'histoire comme on colorie vite une image, et peu importe qui se fait tuer chaque fois je le vis mal, on croit en nos gendarmes qui servent et nous protegent, du moins, est ce au rwanda quand ils jouent du lance-roquettes?, pour placer le pantin qui conviendra a la france, une casserole de plus au ministere de la defense, ils se crepent le chignon, au fond ils sont ignobles, sur la conscience des deputes y'en a plus d'un million, quand ils faut des aiguilles nos politiques ont des chignoles, defilent sur des chars le 14 ils se pignolent, au son de la marseillaise et d'une imagerie guerriere, qu'ils veulent tranquillement refiler aux eleves, de leur appart dans le 16, on voit un tableau different: ils disent croire en dieu mais croient en ce qu'ils possedent, ils trouvent meme pas un corps dans les ruines du world trade, mais sortent des debris le passeport de mohamed, je peux plus exprimer combien on trouve ca grotesque, tu comprends pourquoi c'est le desert dans les bibliotheques, au college de la vie ils jouent les profs d'histoire, et abreuvent le quotidien de milles sornettes illusoires, on a bati une forteresse, l'a nomme alamut, coinces physiquement entre garde a vue et garde a vous, compte tenu de la pression patriotique, j'admire les gens de gauche en israel, en amerique, est-ce qu'on vaut mieux en france? desole si j'insiste, mais regardons nous franchement on est aussi racistes, ensuite on vend de la liberte au marche public, putain le drame avec les valeurs de la republique, la republique, elle passe ses week-end en regate, puis se prostitue de toutes parts pour un airbus ou une fregate, elle execute dans une grotte des opposants kanaks, et mange a table avec des gars style giancana, puis explose le rainbow warrior, et dessine les frontieres du tiers-monde a la terrasse du marriott, sponsorise les fanatiques aux 4 coins du monde, les entraine au combat et manipuler les bombes, le collier casse, ces cons echappent a tout controle, et quand ils mordent la main du maitre alors on crie aux monstres, ils discutent notre futur autour d'un pichet, pour notre securite zarma, ils veulent nous ficher, c'est la france de derriere les stores, et j'en ai marre de m'faire gruger par des tronches de dispenses de sport, je me bats pas pour la porsche mais pour un meilleur monde, avec mes petits bras, souvent a cette epoque ou la terreur gronde, ou la frayeur monte, je travaille sur moi chaque seconde pour etre un meilleur homme, on vit en ces temps ou dans un taudis de paris, 36 gosses meurent brules vifs quand les demandes en hlm dorment, depuis des annees dans les archives, alors que des employes de la mairie en obtiennent avec terrasse et parking, t'appelle pas ca du racisme?, apres ils pleurent quand perdus on revient aux racines, ils ont caricature nos discours radicaux, et l'ont resumes par "wesh wesh" ou "yo yo"!, nous, complexes, si peu surs de soi, on s'interpelle entre nous, comme rital, rebeu ou renoi, chaque jour, la grande ville resserre l'etreinte, et tu peux voir les noms des notres evapores, ecrits sur des trains, ma vie, un mic, une mixette, loin des ambitions, de qui sera elu president en 2007, j'adore ce moment ou ils devoilent le minois, de qui devra tailler des pipes monumentales aux chinois, a defaut d'argent putain, donnons du temps, dans nos bouches le mot liberte devient insultant, car c'est les soldats qui le portent et non plus le vent, comme si le monde etait rempli de cruels sultans, mecontent des schemas qu'on nous propose, je cultive maintenant, les roses dans mon microcosme, mesure les degats minimes que mon micro cause, ca ne peut qu'aller mieux alors j'attends la fin de leur monde."

there, start getting nervous, i fight to have my way, the town thug uh, l'm rare and precious, i love myself so much uh, my way - if i was supposed to live and die for the charts, i wouldn't be making music anyways, those meant for success will make it, and those who weren't don't have a chance, going headfirst to the ground, i hit hard, no modifiers needed, i'm just a gangster, a psycho who's got no fear, that's me, i'm a dotdae, south korea's dotdae, one and only fuckin one and only, i'm a natural, bob your head, you keep reaching for me, getting addicted, i'm a dotdae, south korea's dotdae, one and only fuckin one and only, i'm a natural, bob your head, you keep reaching for me, getting addicted, what do you know to be judging me like that, i'm just me, and i don't care much for money, those golden utensils you speak of?, i use them to spoon up dirt, they tell me to follow the path, my well-off sunbaes have laid out, but i don't exactly agree, because from down here, it doesn't look all that great up there, yo in the b-grade life, i'm the head honcho, punk, if this pisses you off, bring it on - this is how i play, punk, excluding me, all the kids these days need a good spanking, using english that they don't even speak, making a show of saying popular greetings, if you're asking how i've got the balls to wild out like this, it's my baseless confidence and cockiness, bitch, fuck me up if you will, i'm a dotdae, south korea's dotdae, one and only fuckin one and only, i'm a natural, bob your head, you keep reaching for me, getting addicted, i'm a problem child, try setting me on fire, i'm the one and only, i couldn't care less, warning to all: i'm foolish, so i choose to ignore it all, i'm a dotdae, south korea's dotdae, one and only fuckin one and only, i'm a natural,

because the reality is to difficult to handle, i tried to find things that can fill me up, which eventually turns out to be drinks, i become indifferent to any situations, even though i'm better off by myself, loneliness hits me from time to time, even though i want to do many different things, i become lethargic, my answer will always be a huge smile if anyone asks how i'm doing, i feel like everyone has turned their back on me, i feel bad for myself, i feel so small, when i become lonely, if you ever witness my tears, please walk past by me, i'm ok, don't comfort me, you don't have to

everyone making it a big deal when i'm fine?, my breakup was a bit tough, left me with a small scratch, i know it is going to be way better after a day or two, silence means "please be happy", tears mean "i truly loved you", i won't die just because she left me, so please don't look at me as if you're looking at someone who's dying, just like when the wind blows, the autumn leaves tremble, and just like when the waves occur, the ocean trembles, i trembled because the love past by me, if you ever witness my tears, please walk past by me, i'm ok, don't comfort me, you don't have to have pity on me, you don't have to stay with me, i'm fine, i'm ok, don't worry about me, you don't have to mind about me, i'm used to be alone, i'm ok, you've broken every piece of me when you laughed out, as if my sadness didn't mean anything to you, leave me alone, don't come to me, i don't want to start anything when i know you're going to leave me in the end, i'm ok, don't comfort me, you don't have to have pity on me, you don't have to stay with me, i'm fine, i'm ok, don't worry about me, you don't have to mind about me, i'm used to be alone, i'm ok, you don't know anything, don't act like you know everything, you say that this is all for me, well what can i say, i want to be alone, so please leave me alone"

cela a servi?, le temps tue le physique, mais l'esprit demeure, rien ne parvient a le briser, pharaon reviens, l'humanite entiere, sous le joug de quelques matieres, de metaux et de pierres, comment demeurer sincere?, c'est ce qui jadis perdit l'etre de chaire dans un realisme, d'anthropomorphisme, au depend du monotheisme solaire, mystique pere de l'islam, sheitan, mon ame t'envoie dans les flammes, car mon coeur est pierre noire, mon souffle est oriental, mon oeil droit est un croissant, mon oeil gauche une etoile, la poussiere leche les contours blancs des mosquees, et la voix de bilal s'echappe du haut des minarets, je sens des frissons dans mon dos resonnant comme un appel, du cote des contrees ou le soleil s'eleve dans le ciel, des plats ciseles de cuivre jaune, une odeur de the, la chaleur m'assomme, des milliers d'unites, un centre immuable, d'un motif qui revient et revient, invariable, les legions de la force du 7 aux quatre coins de l'horizon, assurent la securite sempiternelle, re-hor-akhti, superbe et supreme, dans la voute celeste, inonde le double-pays de kempt, je cree une fresque et le texte est une arabesque, focalise ma pensee a l'orient vers la mecque, comme les bacteries, les plantes et les betes, je vis et etudie les paroles de 144 000 prophetes, et dans ma bibliotheque, plonge dans l'anthropologie, ou l'analyse du spectre lumineux, voue au succes de mes essais, pour etendre le champ de vision de l'infrarouge a l'ultraviolet, mes etudes ne se font pas dans des tubes, elles sont le produit de 1700 cm3, defiant toutes les lois physiques observees, pour une fois la lumiere jaillit de l'obscurite, des couleurs vives animent ces rimes, comme l'a fait michel-ange sur le plafond de la chapelle sixtine, a la seule difference ou je pratique, un art mosaique de l'unique a l'interieur du multiple, tel khalife al mahmoun qui prit byzance naguere, je ne reclame que des livres anciens pour butin de guerre, car mon dogme est le savoir de ce que l'homme a laisse choir, avant la destruction de la partie orientale de notre histoire, le tiers-monde et sa misere materielle, l'occident et sa misere spirituelle, la connaissance mutuelle, pour qu'il existe un lendemain, pharaon reviens, je reve d'avoir ce livre ouvert sous mes yeux, en trois langues differentes: latin, arabe et hebreux, il contient le savoir ultime et la sagesse infime, des inities egyptiens, libanais disciples du calife al hakim, amenophis iv en est le pere et le fils, illustre ancetre de la secte des batenis, mon dieu n'a pas de statue, c'est un fond pas une forme, il serait pretentieux de lui donner celle d'un homme, dans nos genes sont inscrites les essences de la creation, initiatique, divine est la raison, puis vint la contraire, puis vint l'esprit puis la base, puis vint le verbe, puis le precedent, enfin le suivant, tel est le cierge du monotheisme incite, 2 essences pour le mal, 5 en toute limite, a ne pas franchir, ou le demon te ligote, car quiconque depasse les frontieres de dieu est un despote, paix a ceux qui obeissent au sadr el islam, et gardent des principes purs de tout exegese erronee, honte a ceux qui disent qu'un homme ecrivit le coran, denommant les musulmans mahometans, maintenant pour les ignares obscurs moyenageux, chevaliers croises, croyant toujours aussi fort sans s'informer, que les musulmans ont un dieu different, les chretiens arabes l'appellent aussi allah precise le vatican, ces gens sourient avec une suffisance, qui n'a d'egal que l'insuffisance de leurs connaissances, "oui, mais voyez comme ces gens sont stricts", "pas de contraintes dans la religion": sourate 2 verset 256, le coran respecte ainsi les croyants d'autres confessions, citant les juifs et chretiens comme etant dignes d'admiration, oppose au developpement des sciences l'occident, pendant de nombreux siecles appris beaucoup de l'orient, et il est temps de le dire, car notre arbre est le prisonnier d'une formidable spire, l'histoire, du cote de l'aube debuta, et vers les terres du crepuscule chemina, sais-tu ce qu'il y aura si le ciel reste sanguin?, la nuit. pharaon reviens, le cote obscur vous a presente "ombre est lumiere", avec: geo dans le role de shurik'n, eric dans le role de kheops, pascal dans le role de l'architecte imhotep, malek dans le role du sultan, tchoua dans le role de kephren, chill

fait des sons, j'serai toujours trop nouveau, trop ancien ou pas assez recent, faite de chance, de soleil, de violence, ma ville a ses raisons, en france la police tue, la justice dit rien d'interessant, ceux qui prennent le risque de m'test subissent un supplice, les medias savent bien que pour faire peur, suffit d'un suffixe, j'sors d'un chemin hors-norme, j'renvoie la balle au rap, la concurrence au diable, l'esprit hip-hop au crematorium, a.k. ne fait pas du rap, ni du chant, il fait d'la science, j'leur chanterai youssou n'dour pendant leur minute de silence, c'est pire aujourd'hui, petit frere prefere bibi au tcheks speed, arme pour de vrai, tire, laisse la bibliotheque vide, l'avenir m'envoie des sextos, j'te l'dis texto, que leur major me donne leur expo, j'deviens un ex-pauvre, on a de l'ambition mais l'esperance de vie d'un megot, j'veux de l'argent, vu que l'argent compte plus que la vie d'un negro, je rec', toujours sans pitie t'facon plus rien a prouver, pas trop souvent sur les reseaux, ils s'plaignent de pas m'y retrouver, mais j'pourrai jamais perdre la main en flow j'ai jamais foire, bien sur, y'aura toujours des langues de putes pour nier les faits, je le leur dis facon biggie dans "it was all a dream", tema frerot, je rime et ton jean n'est plus clean, generation leatherface, chainsaw c'est le style, reviens sans cesse hanter le screen comme une lame a halloween, aloha, c'est pas la devise, au centre-ville tout s'ecroule, a l'heure ou les fachos d'europe s'unissent pour baiser les foules, on est tous pistes sur ecoute, ou c'est moi qui part en couille?, t'facon la planete derouille, la desillusion m'etouffe, je juge plus, regarde nipsey on vas tous mourir, quand les rappeurs font du zouk pour pas bibi toute une vie, certains s'attribuent le crime de leur crew pour faire les viriles, la verite sur youtube ne rapporte que peu de vues, j'suis la depuis les flinstones, depuis ericsson et les ringtones, envoie la cryptomonnaie, tu vois bien que le beat cogne, tu me parles de rien, tu m'parles de cash, tout a coup j't'ecoute, j'viens reanimer la rue, j'lui fait du bouche a bouche d'egout, t'as la meilleure dope, ouais c'est ca, ferme ta gueule, essaie ca, si tu veux etre livre avec iam, on fera le necessaire, la trap, tu l'as accentuee mais tu rapes sans tuer, on s'gave comme gargantua, de la table, absent tu es, trop de talla dans leurs speechs, trop de tabac dans leurs sbires, j'me dis que la nature est bien faite quand ils font les canards devant leurs biches, zin, j'les avale quand j'inspire, ou j'les rafales quand j'expire, aucun detritus dans l'ecriture je travaille comme shakespeare, zin, on a la genetique, pour survivre a la scene de tir et tenir jusqu'au generique, j'avoue que j'suis un gros mytho quand j'mets un pied chez les flics, destruction dans ma vision, zin, si j't'ai double, c'est que la realite depasse la fiction, c'rap c'est un appart', c'est tout un art de l'amenager, des concierges de toutes parts, au moindre ecart, on sent le danger, 300 rue des barbares, trop de cafards voudraient y loger, beaucoup ne pensent qu'a le ronger, qu'a le singer, qu'a le figer, que tous braquent leurs satellites, des tuiles jusqu'au plancher, comme ca ils pourront voir que c't'equipe la n'a rien a cacher, le jour on cherche nos mines pour que le crime soit presque parfait, et le soir on traque le rythme afin que nos hymnes aient pu te devorer, aucune demi-mesure, soit tu te couches, soit tu fais all in, on a fait le choix, depuis trop de snipers visent nos poitrines, les propos corrosifs placent nos tetes au centre de la cible, mais le regard lointain, on garde quand meme un pied sur nos racines, eh, bienvenue dans l'equipe ou l'impossible devient possible, c'est, un pack de fauves qui pete les portes jusqu'au premier essai, conjurer le sort, changer le decor, redoubler d'efforts on l'fait, on creer nos sons dans le secret donc t'attends pas a trop sucrer, j'parle des coins francais comme ceux de la-bas au pays, quand j'rappe y a tout mars' derriere moi comme sur le selfie de balotelli, vulgaire envers l'elu d'ma ville, l'etat, pour etre honnete, quand j'cause du maire t'as l'impression que j'suis atteint de gilles de la tourette, marre de voir un futur anxieux jalonner les rues d'mon coin, comment ambitionner d'avoir mieux quand on ne craint plus que d'avoir moins?, on a le choix entre se revolter, fermer les yeux et s'laisser faire?, si un homme a plus que ce qu'il ne faut c'est que d'autres manquent du necessaire, berce par le desespoir c'est triste quand la douleur s'reveille, c'est l'histoire d'une lame de rasoir qui joue la funambule sur une veine, moi je suis entre le gars nia qui hait la haine my man, et le gars qui aime imiter le mia sur l'album de iam, rare de voir un de tes zinc neutre, dans les impairs y'a 1 3 5 7 9 ou un 3.5.7 neuf, aie de l'estime envers ces vers, meme si le fond en perd ses formes, si dugarry critique ces versets freres, j'suis sur de percer fort, nous voila vingt dans la barque au bas mots a defiler "yes we can", vois le mic', prends le mic', tue ce rap a coup de "all you can", canailleries, railleries, joailleries, taillent le mythe, il a dit qu'elle a dit qu'on a dit ont noye le rythme, on a bu au caniveau, gratte au casino, ouais minot, rives au camino, affine la weed aux haribos, varies, arrives, vanilles, maries au barrio, fatigues de montrer que luigi n'est pas mario, j'suis le bon canasson, v'la le son t'as pige mon garcon?, valider tes idees? sorry non, j'en fais mon paillasson, j'vends du reve, t'as les restes, m.r.s. c'est la maison, drafte par les nyc knicks du rap, c'est ma saison, fait par nous, fait pour nous, fais tourner, shoote a l'unisson, pleurent seuls, oeuvrent seuls, meurent seuls, de vrais manu micron, petits chefs, petit plans, pour reves moribonds, corrigeons la visee, convergeons et touchons l'horizon, jeunesse a l'agonie, je ne sens plus son pouls, shit et alcool dans les veines, comme d'hab' une histoire a dormir debout, encore une mere se noie dans ses peines, que faire quand le berger est du cote des loups? et pretends tenir les rennes, quotidien est a gerber, je vomis le tout, tout en encaissant les coups que la vie assene, du mal a compter ceux qui sont sous ecrous, ont serre ou purgent des peines, on a deja du mal a joindre les deux bouts, rester debout comment voir le bout du tunnel?, mauvaise reputation, traines dans la boue, de bout en bout du coup la coupe est pleine, beaucoup voudront jamais tendre la joue, la main sur le joujou, craquent et braquent et degainent, toujours lucide j'vois les descentes des larmes en rivieres et des plaies, les jours se suivent et se ressemblent, on regarde la misere en replay, le diable les appate puis les acclame, quel vacarme, ils visent tout ce qui brille, vivent que dans le speed vide et sans etats d'ames, fidele a mon art, a ma voix je debite, je n'ecoute pas ceux qui parlent et debitent, et me tape beaucoup de barres mais rattrape mon retard, poto je demarre au quart, mets les gaz et vais vite, pave dans la marre, je casse les mythes, debit barbare et regarde les rimes, je suis dans le delire a part, je me demene et mene ma barque, rape, frappe et jamais n'hesite, crane blanc sur les corps dessine, ca sent l'hymne a la punition, haro sur les figures deguisees, des que sonne la fin des illusions, crane blanc sur les corps dessine, ca sent l'hymne a la punition, haro sur les figures deguisees, des que sonne la fin des illusions, des que

trempe nos mains dans les armes, le charbon et les cartes, on a gere 2 spots, on a fini a 1 000, nos soldats ont quadrille une partie de la ville, me voila assis sur le siege passager, on va voir 2 gars qui veulent nous rencontrer, j'allume une clope, me tourne vers shams, frerot pourquoi t'as pris cette caisse degueulasse?, il repond: la discretion c'est pas ton fort, je souris, regarde par la fenetre deux gazelles courir, sur ce, on roule un quart d'heure environ, on parle, on rit, on chambre, on crie nos plans bidons, on les evoque avec des larmes plein les yeux, on s'eclate, nos visages dans les creux, des mains, vous etes tares, je tire un tissu de ma poche, pourquoi on va tout droit, je croyais qu'on tournait a gauche?, j'ai cru leurs bobards, leurs promesses allechantes, le monde

clairiere, mais qu'est-ce qu'on fout la?, shams me regarde, soudain il prend son arme, il me dit: "tu sais ce qu'il arrive a ceux qui vendent leur ame, on m'a souffle que tu causais souvent aux bleus, que tu nous tapes de belles liasses quand tu le peux, que tu manges aux rateliers des autres equipes, ton nom revient trop dans la bouche de ma cherie", les autres ne disent rien, il pointe sa petoire, sur mon visage, et bang, il me tire dans la machoire, le carreau eclate, ma tete pend dehors, il ouvre la porte et me vire d'un coup de pied dans l'epaule, defigure, je pisse le sang, eux partent en trombe, crament la caisse sur un terrain vague a 2 bornes, desarticule sur le ventre je sens venir la fin, quand est arrivee cette femme qui baladait son chien, sur mon lit d'hopital je me ressasse tout, de toutes leurs accusations aucune n'etait vraie, c'est fou, comment des amis d'enfance peuvent croire des ragots, niquer la confiance, ce style de vie nous rend paranos, j'avais pas ca en moi, la fibre pour le crime, je crois que tout ce bordel c'etait que pour les suivre, je repense a mon pere qui a quitte cette vie, et qui me disait si souvent quand j'etais petit, j'ai cru leurs

nous a rassembles des l'ecole, une equipe s'est formee, ou chacun avait son role, tres tot on a compris que l'union faisait la force, les flingues ont fait le reste et nous, on est devenus des boss, unis comme les doigts de la main, on a dictes nos lois, impitoyables, nos affaires ont pris beaucoup de poids, pas une ombre au tableau, pas un flic a l'horizon, jour apres jour, on a grandi en meme temps que le reseau, on se voyait au moins une fois par jour a la maison, comme les puissants, on faisait tout dans la discretion, on discutait business autour d'une bouteille de bourbon, clara et fredo se lancaient dans une grande discussion, d'ailleurs, a part lui et sa caisse on la jouait profil bas, le fisc pouvait debarquer et ca on ne le voulait pas, j'ai bien essaye de lui parler, mais il n'entendait rien, et dehors, ca commencait a jaser, j'ai cru ses bobards, ses promesses allechantes, le monde est petit, mais la famille est grande, certaines personnes scellent elle-meme leur

affichait le pognon, et dans le quartier ca commencait a poser trop de questions, parfois, quand j'arrivais chez moi, il etait deja la, clara et lui s'entendaient bien et ca, ca me plaisait de moins en moins, a partir de la, j'ai eu des soupcons, l'ambiance est devenue beaucoup plus tendue pendant les reunions, j'ai commence a voir les autres sans le prevenir, je leur ai parle des trucs bizarres qu'on entendait dire, je n'en dormais plus, je crois qu'au fond, je m'attendais au pire, meme si j'ai jamais cru qu'un jour l'un de nous pouvait trahir, ca devenait trop chaud, il fallait prendre une decision, j'en ai parle avec les autres, ils m'ont donne raison, c'est comme ca qu'on en est arrive a la conclusion, qu'il allait falloir se debarrasser de ce petit con, on a invente l'histoire avec les deux gars, j'ai appele fredo, je lui ai parle du rencard, a bord d'une caisse volee, on est passe chez lui le soir, et je crois que vous connaissez deja la fin de l'histoire, j'ai cru ses bobards,
