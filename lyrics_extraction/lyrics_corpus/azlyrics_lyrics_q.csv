legacy every day than i meant to see, everyone here is impaired so scary and, medicine but i know enemy cuz i go, walking away - block and what sapna k, shot in the face gun loggin loaded them, off at the race drop in the face officer, place brought in a way predict you what, i will probably say and at the end of, the day still talking a mesa obviously, let the audience say so let me explain, this to to those who came in looking at, the state to see an awakened thing these, famous when they don't understand that i, take race and i make his from basic, playlist to the greatest than the team, in the nation be patient was waiting for, me to break in re-energize the lyrics to, memorize start an enterprise a better, guide so can i be successful and never, try that's my dream job being lazy just, sitting with the tv on they say that i'm, right like me on ba i ain't taking, responsibility pay me for having, with little humidity but whatever i'm, doing it seems to be killing me i'm a, willingly artistically fitting into this, history trying to show you one better, but none of you believe me trying to win, this go and try hard good game gg you, beat me and now you see me in 3d but you, can't feel me showing up on your device, control option d lee consider me part of, heatley measure myself from retweets, i'll be talking away more chill so you, can reach me instead of pretending you, understand what i'm talking about i'm, sipping you kind of scared for like a, haunted house trying to show you, something instead of just sitting on the, couch i'll be honest now i rarely end up, walking now into reality getting allowed, to be actually a high belief by myself, doing nothing you don't laugh at me why, cuz ideally you would do the same thing, nothing cos for a brain that is amazing, it's now complaining but the best part, of life is not even living it love, sleeping and just using it and never, much time is limited and i better figure, this perform slipping this opportunity, on my fingertips now let me just tell, you what i came to do trying to show you, why can rap as fast as i'm able to, trying to show you why can hop in here, like a kangaroo and say some stupid, metaphors and leave out there i'm, breaking through and if a major record, label is looking at me i'm a nice guy, with bad teeth got a nice id for bad, beats i can't use ride fast their raps, slow i may make mistakes but everyone, has so i'm like mj back when he had the, afro oh so i'm not black so maybe not, but before everyone gets angry stop i'm, that person they're people naturally, heymy blood all the people who keep on, going crazy off because i won't be, making amazing songs in a mainstream car, a lot of prominent features i'm a, confident speaker with some dominant, teachers i deserve to be a starter but, constantly on the bleachers i'm awfully, smaller cheaper when i'm up on a spot, and eager baby fearing this every time, that they hear and it don't know that my, lyrics had a precision of building a, pyramid so when you live in this please, let me know when i'm standing here, frozen please let it go hit metronome, combine the compilation to unlock, superstardom and move all across the, nation but that it's just a dream and, probably a combination of a big ego and, false encouragement on the way in but, when i'm playing it just know it's all a, big game i'm just trying to blow up and, have a big name but when you think about, it it is all insane working be created, from chemicals in this brain but when, you look at me a lack of respect when, i'm cracking my neck so that i can rap, to my chest cousin of bread some say, that it's magic i step until i'm on the, same stage that you have it again but so, when you think about the hall of fame, you think about a people used to sit and, call your name and you check and wonder, if it will be artists a step back into, reality it all remains damn alright i, just spilled water on my computer right, now on my computers breaking while i'm, doing this thirty thousand words shit, goddamn it, my lyrics are not showing up on a swing, you know when, what i mean this is off the top i don't, need to use no machines hold up i know i, can freestyle but i can't do it forever, but i am very clever okay, okay i'm gonna take a drink if you're, watching this take a drink - these are, some shit that you can drink - but drink, water unless you're of age you know what, i'm saying hey okay okay hey i feel like, i'm way too different ridiculous most of, humanity's made of idiots i barely even, get myself and you thinking you, understand you think i to be highly, screen gives you the upper hand please, what i do is barely poetry this hope for, me i'm noticing people starting to, notice me but still consider me, confidence then consider me ready and, giving out all my flawlessness bye, honestly all of this is haunting me, probably it is just a sense of myself, wobble and toppling into awfully small, pieces normally all leaving is tragic, and knobs leading it follows me all, evening it's calling my name it, constantly makes it so hard to stay away, i close my eyes i let it go and it all, fades away yeah we're just trying to, find a great escape to get away from how, we live in life day to day some people, fight it in a drink or in a cup or in, some bling or branded drug or any things, that give us love but all i know is that, it's tough and all i know is that the, stuff isn't enough is way too much i'm, showing you like this dictator man what, i gotta do to make this quick paper, these kid haters are like 10 years open, still claim to be big players that shit, will make me go but i'm aiming, um and lo got amazing bronze in a crazy, flow when i may be live but i came to, show

living now in my, mind's eye given out lots of songs with, responses that i never pictured wow damn, damn, this beast way too holy to rap over, mental block my minds capacities that's, love with your raps lower they lack, closer they lack substance like a, printer without tony y'all filling pages, that have nothing oh but i have got, something to tell you i ain't got some, money or bullshit to sell you speaking, from late nights i'm thinking the, drake's like watching these inner who's, thinking one day i might be on that, stage right beside all these players, shit's up to me i won't hide it in, prayers i'll prove it in the music i, used to influence i do this to wait, harder than people assuming resume in my, writing if you win this lighting that, puts me to be in the view of the height, and i do what they like and but that, makes them hate me no matter what i do, they just mistake the reason i'm flowing, the reason i start up not just for the, fame and the money this dumb person, damn i talking about the carpet place, most to these rappers only bright this, shit using copy/paste i'd have made a, lot of songs that go to waste i just, need a homerun i already loaded bass

shit seems so damn loud, to me recently i have been feeling, alienated my songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made i'm a baby, i'm crazy don't hate me don't hate me, cuz i'm different but hate me because, you hate me then maybe we can live with, that people say that this is the biggest, thing to hop on the screen all will, scream overreacting like it's a trauma, scene y'all are
