"oakes, ryan","https://www.azlyrics.com/r/ryanoakes.html","a love story","https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ryanoakes/alovestory.html","i remember the first date, movies then home, it was a classic, you told me to kiss you it was late and i still hadn't, i went in for the kiss who woulda known about the static, that we felt at the same time would end up with a drastic impact, holding you tight i felt alive, spent years on my own all alone i been deprived, with that perfect connection, and someone to call mine, especially the perfection, that you put on the line, it escalated to a second date, and then onto a third, it escalated to i love you, someone i'll be putting first, it's complicated that i trust you, i been broken up and hurt, but you sedated all the thoughts up in my head to make it work, so why not, give it a shot and take a leap, the only time that you'll fall is when i sweep you off your feet, i'ma give it my all, the kinda love that digs deep, i'ma be there to call on all those nights you never sleep, had insecurities until you threw them all away, happy i was being me, and that you took away pain, i promised you i'll never leave if you could promise me the same, you're the reason that i breathe baby look what you became, got no shame, girl i'm in love and i'll express it, i thought i'd never fall but i guess you were an exception, with the way the world's going i still got a piece of heaven, everything i coulda wished for my eleven, eleven and that's real, but things change right, thought i said the truth and then i went and switched lanes like, i don't need love and this music in the same life, i was so naive, i could put 'em in the same light, i spoke right from the heart, every second from the start, i never planned on leaving you or ripping everything apart, now you're wearing all my scars, staring straight up at the stars, questioning why this all happened wishing everything was ours, i never meant to lie, i broke it off because i thought my time, with all this music shit was running out, and life was flying by, and you were second guessing everything inside your mind, my excuse is that we gave it everything and that we tried, but sometimes, trying isn't gonna make it work, and sometimes, people leave relationships hurt, but this one time, i had thought that we wouldn't for sure, we got one life, and i thought i would spend it all with her, now all we got is memories, all we got is memories, and wishing we were meant to be, hoping that eventually, you would see the end with me, but now i'm stuck inside my head and reading every text you ever sent to me, damn, its funny how life goes, we fight through the pain every night and despite those, lines in the stories of our lives we write those, every single time even if we don't like those, it's new years now, my phone rings and i left to go and check it, almost hit delete but i hit play and heard the message, you were drunk as hell it coulda got to you, you let it, drunk words are sober thoughts so i'm still happy that you said it, hearing that you missed me almost made me feel pathetic, but that's everything that's echoing inside my fucking head it, its life throwing us second chance at least that's how i read it, as a chance to try this all again to go and make an edit, we can't change the past but we can change the way we end it, girl they say that time is money you're the reason that i spend it, thinking all 'bout the future and the ways that i'll amend it, and incorporate you into it, it's time to stop pretending, it can't work, it's time to stop blowing through the signs, telling us to slow down, go reverse and rewind, cause i think i know now, that it hurt but we fine, girl you make me so proud, when i can say you're mine so, here's to another door being opened, and fixing all the pain, that accompany the broken, heart ain't the same, but i'm sick of all this choking, happening inside my brain, i'm just living in the moment, girl if we been chosen, we can run away from fade, i can fly you to the moon, and if you're still in need of space, don't let emptiness consume you, i'm right here and i'ma stay, to make sure i try to blew you, into your own saving grace, i got a lotta upon my plate, i don't wanna eat alone, see i'm here to lift the weight, if going through life on your own, i'd rather do it late than never, girl i still see room to grow, we've been through these great endeavors, we've still got plenty more to roam, so its time to let it go, give in and get a grip, baby what's a crazy life without learning to take risks?, baby what's a crazy life without accepting what we did?, and taking everything in front of us, and loving what it is, fast forward to the present, it's feeling like it's heaven, i was stuck up in the dark, you were my anti-depressant, every time i saw you, i lit up and got florescent, baby every time i saw you, was your new greatest impression, down since day one, let's make it work and take the mission, that ride or die life laying right by your side of every minute, the best part of the story, is that its still isn't finished, then and i pray to god, that this isn't the only chapter written, i'm gone"
