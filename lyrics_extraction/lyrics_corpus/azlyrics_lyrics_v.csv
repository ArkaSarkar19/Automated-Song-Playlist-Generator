something, but it's not coming into my ears, my heart is only for you, the words i'm mumbling are stories about you, without knowing, i'm only talking about you, you are in every word i say, yeah, you spill out in every word i say, yeah, what do i like to do?, what is a normal day for me?, it's hard for me to answer, those typical questions, because my answer is you, because my answer is you, because i only think of you, the more she smiles, the sadder i get, as time goes by, the more i feel like a sinner, at this rate, i think i'll end up alone again today, the more we talk, the lonelier i get and i'm in danger again, she's saying something, but it's not coming into my ears, i have nothing more to say, i'm such a bad guy, she's being so affectionate, but why do i keep thinking of you?, you are in every word i say, yeah, you spill out in every word i say, yeah, what do i like to do?, what is a normal day for me?, it's hard for me to answer, those typical questions, because my answer is you, it's like your voice, is in this sweet melody, i know it's not real but i keep tuning my ear to it, yeah i know this is foolish imagination, but if i can meet you through this song, i don't care if my ears rip, if only you can hear it, if only i could feel your eyes, nose, lips and warm breath, you get repeated in every word i say, yeah, my grudge-like love story is you, yeah, what do i love?, what do i care about the most?, i really hope, she doesn't ask me, because my answer is you, because my answer is you, because i love only you"

can't get rid of you, yeah white lights and prism, although the color and shape seem clear, but in the form that is invisible, my world is locked up woo ye ye, be filled in the arms, that are without control woo ye ye, eh, i have been searching, for the very first scent, eh, the stimulation which ties up and looks just like you, everyday, the scent the sweet obsessions to counting it, in the dark room, thousands of colors are scattered, i cover myself with you again, and again, it's all over my body, you are over my body, complete dizziness, you and i won't be ruined, come and fall into me, i will never hurt you, so hold my hand, i'm certain for my experiment, you're complete dizziness, gorgeous yet monotonous pattern, natural with cherry blossoms, don't think about it, on that moment, stimulating the nose by sending a deep scent, you already know, multiplying colors and your frequency of stimulation, the falling strings of my insanity and your gaps of wall, closed my eyes, the moment i left you in the darkness, until you reach deep unfolded in brilliant lights, inhaling deeply, inhaling you again, and again, locking you up in my body, locking you up so that you won't be gone, vivid scent of swirl, it's drawn in front of my eyes, the long suffering dizziness is full, blooming than flowers, it seeped again, and again into the closed eyes, you seeped so that only i can see"
