up slumber to rise above the surface, if you just think about playing, and fall into that then you're just wasting time, increasing every 3-place numbers with commas, account for only how much you earn, confess your sins to the bank, i bought a new moncler for my mom, i got rid of my maserati, and instead i drive a porche, i'mma get on this tv mama, the kid who said that, got called over from

drinking parties, instead i drink hard liquor by myself, i outsmart you and steal your rice bowls, i'm the achilles' heel to lazy-asses, your top priority is a retirement plan, and preparing for old age, that's good method, people interested look at my reputation, there are a lot of idiots who sign contracts for just 300, so they can wear blue dial submariner watches, fuck off, i'm with domain

hands has come, looking at my active state, must taste so bitter, so i hope at least some hate comments are left, it's attention, here you go, my dreams are predictive, in the end they are actualized, labelled as the best, while establishing myself in two areas, i joke around in the waiting room, with that hyung who wants, to do a track with me, ha, in the future even when i get older, i won't

calling you without reason, joking with you with trivial jokes, telling our story like it's not ours, to my friends and be satisfied with friends' reaction, there are many embarrassing things but, i can't even understand myself and this is, what called love - life is like this. even though i want, something desperately - i can't have it easily, pride and prejudice tell me what is more important, i was wrong ain't nothing but love, people change as time goes by. they were, never like this - it's cruel but stay in your lane, smile and practise how to speak nicely, so many coincidences that was planned, if you fall in love at first sight, even a realist, becomes reckless to achieve it, the canvas that i tried to erase the painting is ruined, i'm always on the same page even though i open the, book again - your presence itself made a mark on my life, and i became a detective who's tracing those, my life is a made-up fantasy, but before i knew, i was writing about my story, without reading a book or a movie. i was scared, i was bad. eventually we became nobody, even though we used to be the closest, you put a period on me saying good bye, which isn't really what i wanted to say, i shouldn't have loved you reticently, sadness is overflowing even though i try to accept it, pride and prejudice tell me what is more important, i was wrong ain't nothing but love, people change as time goes by. they were, never like this - it's cruel but stay in your lane, the chances that i missed, because i said i was busy, an impulsive one night love, all of those were actually my pride, pride and prejudice tell me what is more important, i was wrong ain't nothing but love, people change as time goes by. they were, never like this - it's cruel but stay in your lane"

before, i'm gonna shed your make-up, and let everyone know that it was all an act, why do i hate, i don't understand, the eyes that focus on you, i don't understand, the things you possess at that age, your passionate fans, the tv programs that host you, the musicians that form around you, yo, there's no real incentive, no reason for my hate, but my guilty conscience gets buried by the crowd, no matter what efforts you made, what sufferings you went through, your success gave you the right to be insulted again, i'm gonna pluck the roots of your arrogance, and make your life sway, why is she dating, that unclassy delinquent?, celebrities are blinded by the spotlights, deafened by the applause, so they see and hear but they can't do anything, you can't deceive me, i've seen your face off the screen before, i'm gonna shed your make-up, and let everyone know that it was all an act, why do i hate you, as much as you enjoy your success, you need to pay a bigger price, that's all i wanna tell you about, i'm not your anti anti anti baby, i don't understand your hit songs, the awards you receive every year, your luxurious surroundings, all the profits you make is a disadvantage to me, but if i cause some trouble right now, that'll be nice timing, preparing my mouth for some violent language, our needs are simple, just need one sentence that's off, interpreting it is my job, i'll decide the meaning, 100 good deeds are on the sand, one error gets engraved on stone, see whose loss it is if you become my enemy, the camera lens turns into a gun barrel, you should know eh, no matter how shitty things are for you, you need to dance properly, if you agree say yes, i'm not an anti its fan mail, once you rack up those positive comments, that means you're past your prime, you can't deceive me, i've seen your face off the screen before, i'm gonna shed your make-up, and let everyone know that it was all an act, why do i hate you, as much as you enjoy your success, you need to pay a bigger price, that's all i wanna tell you about, i'm not your anti anti anti baby, listen, the moment you made your stage name, i had to kill you, it's your choice, if you wanna succeed, you need to be criticized, get on the chopping block, professionals always need to smile, you need to be judged to earn popularity, how can privacy exist in a product?, this place and its consumers are king, keep your character in check, hide your face, that's the reason you wear hats and masks, hatred is also interest, how much longer do you think, you'll receive good treatment bro, so be thankful to me, i'll make you lose your way, i hope i can see you for a long time, i'll end this now, you can't deceive me, i've seen your face off the screen before, i'm gonna shed your make-up, and let everyone know that it was all an act, why do i hate you, as much as you enjoy your success, you need to pay a bigger price, that's all i wanna tell you about, i'm not your anti anti anti baby"
